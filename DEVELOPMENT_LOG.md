Enhanced error handling for authentication:

1. Improved error handling in auth.ts:
   - Added recovery mechanism for "Invalid user data structure" errors
   - Added fallback profile lookup by email when profile validation fails
   - Improved error messages for better user experience
   - Added graceful handling of edge cases during signup

2. Enhanced error handling in supabase/client.ts:
   - Added specific handlers for common auth errors
   - Improved user-facing error messages
   - Added specific handling for "Database error saving new user"
   - Added better handling for already registered users
   - Improved generic error message with debugging hint

3. Next Steps:
   - Monitor error logs for any remaining issues
   - Consider adding more comprehensive error tracking
   - Add more user-friendly error messages in the UI

Added unit tests for authentication system:

1. Created test infrastructure:
   - Installed Vitest, JSDOM, and testing-library packages
   - Added test configuration in vitest.config.ts
   - Created test setup file with mocks for localStorage and window.dispatchEvent
   - Added test scripts to package.json

2. Implemented comprehensive auth.test.ts:
   - Added tests for signUp, login, logout functions
   - Added tests for getCurrentUser, isAuthenticated, getUserRole utilities
   - Implemented mocks for Supabase client and browser APIs
   - Added test cases for success and error scenarios
   - Added validation tests for required fields

3. Next Steps:
   - Run tests to verify authentication fixes
   - Add more tests for edge cases
   - Consider integration tests for auth flow

Fixed authentication system to resolve "Database error saving new user" issue:

1. Created new migration `20250313082500_fix_auth_user_creation.sql`:
   - Simplified the profile creation trigger function with better error handling
   - Added extensive logging for debugging purposes
   - Improved error handling to prevent transaction failures
   - Fixed foreign key constraint with ON DELETE CASCADE
   - Added proper permissions for auth schema access
   - Ensured proper RLS policies for profiles table
   - Added email index and unique constraint
   - Added proper grants for authenticated users

2. Key Improvements:
   - The trigger now continues even if profile creation fails, allowing auth user to be created
   - Added explicit checks for existing profiles to prevent unique constraint violations
   - Added better error logging for debugging
   - Simplified the profile creation process to reduce points of failure
   - Fixed permission issues that could prevent the trigger from working properly

3. Next Steps:
   - Monitor logs for any remaining issues
   - Consider adding a retry mechanism in the auth.ts file for edge cases
   - Add more comprehensive error handling in the frontend

Fixed database permissions and constraints:

1. Updated migration `20250304094800_fix_auth_system.sql`:
   - Added proper grants for auth schema access
   - Added email index for better performance
   - Ensured foreign key constraint exists with ON DELETE CASCADE
   - Added nested exception handling for better error messages
   - Fixed permissions for authenticated users

2. Error Handling Improvements:
   - Added specific handling for:
     * Foreign key violations (auth user not found)
     * Unique constraint violations (duplicate email)
     * Missing required fields
   - Added warning logs for debugging
   - Improved error messages for common failures

3. Next Steps:
   - Monitor foreign key constraint errors
   - Add logging for auth schema access issues
   - Consider adding retry logic for race conditions
   - Add user feedback for permission errors
