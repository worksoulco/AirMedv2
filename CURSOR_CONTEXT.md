# Cursor Context

## Current Implementation Section
- Implementing chat system for patient-provider communication
- Setting up lab system and storage
- Implementing database schema and policies
- Creating frontend components for lab report system
- Configuring RLS policies for secure data access
- Established comprehensive documentation system

## Working Features
- Basic project structure
- Supabase integration
- Authentication system
- React + TypeScript setup
- Database schema documentation
- Core tables defined (invites, habits, goals, users)
- Documentation maintenance rules
- Development tracking system
- Chat system components created
- Real-time message updates
- File attachment support
- Message read status tracking

## Known Issues
- Chat functionality pending database migration

## Current Blockers
- None identified

## Database/Model State
- Multiple migrations present for lab system setup
- Storage bucket creation in progress
- RLS (Row Level Security) policies being implemented
- Core tables documented in DATABASE_SCHEMA.md:
  - invites: Provider invitation system with expiration handling
  - habits: User habit tracking with frequency management
  - goals: User goal management with progress tracking
  - check_ins: Patient check-in system
  - auth.users: Extended user profiles with health data
  - chat_threads: Patient-provider chat conversations
  - chat_messages: Individual chat messages
  - chat_attachments: File attachments for messages
- Relationships established:
  - User authentication references
  - Patient-provider connections
  - Health tracking associations
  - Check-in management

## Active Components
- Chat system (pending database setup)
  - ChatPage: Main chat interface
  - ChatThread: Message display and interaction
  - Real-time message subscription
  - File attachment handling
- Lab report system
- PDF scanner
- Lab history tracking
- Authentication pages
- User profile management
- Goal tracking system
- Habit monitoring

## Next Implementation Focus
1. Apply chat system database migration
2. Test chat functionality
3. Verify file attachments
4. Test real-time updates
5. Complete storage bucket setup
6. Finalize RLS policies
7. Implement frontend lab report components
8. Set up PDF scanning and processing

## Database Schema Status
- Tables:
  - invites: Provider invitation management with security
  - habits: User habit tracking with scheduling
  - goals: Progress monitoring with metrics
  - check_ins: Patient status tracking
  - auth.users: Extended profiles with health data
  - chat_threads: Patient-provider messaging
  - chat_messages: Message content and metadata
  - chat_attachments: Message file attachments
- Security:
  - RLS enabled
  - User-specific access controls
  - Provider access patterns
  - Invite system security
- Data Types:
  - UUIDs for primary keys
  - Timestamps with timezone
  - JSONB for flexible metadata
  - Text fields for main data
  - Numeric for measurements
